My skillcrush ruby challenges
I took classes through Skillcrush.com to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, Git, Command Line/Terminal, plus a whole bunch more! We were encouraged to push all of our ruby challenges to Github, just for practice,  so that's what you see here: all of my practice to learn the Ruby programming language.
